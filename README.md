# ImageGPS
App to add location information to image files using a gpx track recorded while the photos were taken. 
Does this by matching the photo time to the co-ordinates from the gpx file. Allows for correction where the camera time is wrong.

Can either manually enter a correction in seconds, or enter the correct co-ordinates and calculate a correction.

Built with PySimpleGUI. Screenshot below:
